# Hello World
**Hello World** is an platform that allows users to log their previous or upcoming *journeys* anywhere around the world. The more places that a user lists, the more of the map is *coloured* in and the bigger their *stamp book* becomes.

The idea was inspired by **Scratchmap** and the online mobile traveling app **Backpackr**. It was built using the **MEAN** stack in only 5 days.

# How it works
Users have the option to sign up on the site or **sign in with Facebook** thanks to the NPM package Satellizer. They can then list trips to countries that they have taken and even upload some holiday snaps using **NG file upload**. As a user traels to move places they are able to see not only their stamp book increment but they also begin to see that their world map will colour in with all the places that they've been.

# Requirements 
1. Create a website for our final projects that utilises the MEAN stack.
2. Add encryption with BCrypt so that a user can sign in or register to the website.
3. Utilise one or more API for a unique user experience.

# How it was built
**Hello World** was built using the *MEAN* stack (**MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **Angular** and **Node JS**).

It also utilises the following technologies:
<li>**HTML5** - **CSS3** - **JavaScript** - **jQuery** - **SASS**</li>
<li>**Bootstrap** - **Grunt** - **Bower** - **Satellizer** - **NG File Uploads**</li>
<li>**BCrypt** - **JWT** - **Passport** - **Map Glyphs** - **Restcountries.eu**</li>
<li>& **Animate CSS**.</li>

# Planning
I started the project by first writing out my **user journeys** on the website and then followed this flow by creating a series of **wireframes** using *Balsamiq* to initially plan out the look and feel of the site on mobile first.

Following on from this, I then fleshed out my **Trello** with categories of tasks that I would have to accomplish to reach my goal. Throughout the project I used this as a basis to tackle work within smaller, more manageable chunks.
